# Radio observations

A handy program that plots the altitude of an astronomical, usually radio, source in the sky on a given day for a given telescope location. This requires the Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) of the source, and the Earth Latitude (Lat) and Longitude (Lon) of the observing telescope. It also has functionality to print the integration time of the telescope for a given signal-to-noise ratio, provided some basic properties - diameter, observing frequency, bandwidth, aperture effiency and system temperature. To use the program, simply change the global variables at the top of the code and run it!
